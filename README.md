# WTA Puppers Lab
WTA Puppers is a memrization game with puppers! Or at least it wants to be. It seems like the developer who worked on it missed a few things here and there, so while you're playing through the game, make sure you note all the bugs you see and any improvements that you can think of!

Have fun bug bashing!!
